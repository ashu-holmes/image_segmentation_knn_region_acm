Image Segmentation using kNN and Region Based Active Contour Model

A framework which integrates 
kNN with a region-based active contour 
model. Classification probability scores from machine 
learn-ing algorithm, which are regularized using a 
non-linear function, are used to replace the pixel 
intensity values during energy minimization.
